# Vidsy linting

Terraform stacks can quickly get out of sync as different people and teams work on them. At Vidsy we have a set of simple guidelines for stacks to try and keep them consistent and easy to navigate and read.

# Usage

## Releases

The binary is versioned and released on each tagged merge to master, this can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/vidsy/terraform-linter/releases).

Once downloaded and installed, run the following to lint your stack:

```
terraform-linter --tf-directory"/path/to/terrform/files"
```

## Docker

The binary is also built to a container and pushed up to docker hub. To lint the files in the current directory run:

```
docker run --rm=true -v ${pwd}:/stack vidsyhq/terraform-linter --tf-directory="/stack"
```

## Linting rules

The following files are linted within the given stack:

### providers.tf

1. Should only contain 1 or more `provider` configs and one `terraform` config.
